## Project Overview

This project implements **NtuaFlix**, a software application designed for navigating and analyzing movie and TV series data, as well as managing personal collections and recommendations. The system integrates data from IMDb, allowing users to explore metadata such as titles, genres, actors, and more. The project features a full-stack implementation, with a back-end system, CLI, and front-end web interface. 

Key features:
- **Backend subsystem**: Provides a REST API (compliant with OpenAPI 3.0) to support the navigation, selection, and analysis of movie and series data. Users can store collections and manage recommendations for viewing.
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Acts as a client for the backend, allowing users to interact with the ntuaflix application through a terminal-based interface.
- **Frontend application**: A web-based interface (supports HTTPS) for browsing movie and series data, as well as implementing the selected functionalities from the backend.
- **Statistics and data analysis**: Extraction of various statistics and filters based on criteria like genre, ratings, and contributor involvement.
- **Personal collection management**: Users can create and manage their own movie and series collections, and receive personalized recommendations.
- **Data integration**: Supports the import of movie and TV series data from a subset of IMDb, either via API or predefined datasets provided by the course platform (helios).
- **Automated testing**: Includes scripts for automatic testing of the backend functionality to ensure compliance with specified requirements.
- **Version control and project management**: GitHub is used for source code management, version control, and project tracking.
